# Deep image prior

The Project aims to develop unsupervised methods for image segmentation & denoising, addressing limitations of traditional approaches that rely on costly labeled data, to improve the efficiency & stability of image processing.
Image segmentation and denoising are vital in various fields, but traditional methods require labelled data, which is costly and time-consuming; unsupervised approaches offer a scalable alternative by detecting patterns without labeled data.
